## TO DO LIST:

- Brief: Bike Index API

Build an app using the Bike Index API. Your app could list all the bikes that have been registered as stolen in a given location in the past week. Or it could display statistics - for instance, you could see which manufacturer is most frequently stolen in a given area.

- form and submit button. Form has: location(zip), color, manufacturer, results to show.
- colors and resultAmount: picklist, zip code & and manufacturer: text input
- validation on location and color, while resultAmount will have a default resting state
- Return with list of results showing: "title", zip code, "date_stolen", color, description, "url"
- Form lingers, retains selections from previous search. Upon submitting again, original results are wiped and replaced with new ones
- UI Structure: AJ
